• **DIY-Heavy South** — 16 stores · cohesion 0.81 ✅
• **Mixed Urban East** — 13 stores · cohesion 0.76
• **Pro-Heavy Midwest** — 8 stores · cohesion 0.79

Average cohesion: **0.80** — above the healthy threshold of 0.75. Next quarterly re-run is scheduled for **Apr 12, 2026**.`,

  cohesion: `Cohesion scores for CR-018:

| Cluster | Cohesion | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Pro-Heavy South | 0.84 | ✅ Healthy |
| DIY-Heavy South | 0.81 | ✅ Healthy |
| Pro-Heavy Midwest | 0.79 | ✅ Healthy |
| DIY-Heavy West | 0.78 | ✅ Healthy |
| Mixed Urban East | 0.76 | ✅ Healthy |

All 5 clusters are above the 0.75 healthy threshold. The network average is **0.80**.`,

  store: `The network has **70 stores** across 5 behavioral clusters in CR-018.

**Submission status:** 18/70 stores have completed curation (26%).
**8 stores** in the Gulf cluster have not started — curation window closes **Sep 20**.

Top performing stores by velocity:
• Austin Central (TX) — Velocity A · Pro split 75%
• Dallas Uptown (TX) — Velocity A · Pro split 70%
• Chicago South Loop (IL) — Velocity A · Pro split 68%`,

  sku: `The active catalogue contains **35 SKUs**.

• **Core / BG tagged:** 5 SKUs (National Core locked)
• **Agent recommendation:** SOL-SEASHELL flagged for expansion (+12 stores showing demand)
• **Lead time risk:** POR-TRAVERT extended to 20 weeks

Forecast confidence: **87%** · AQG-WARMOAK forecast received today.`,

  forecast: `Forecast status for FW 2025:

• **Overall confidence:** 87%
• **AQG-WARMOAK:** Forecast received today ✅
• **Pipeline stage:** Catalogue step (agent pending)

The agent has not yet run in the Catalogue step. Running the agent will unlock velocity tier recommendations and SKU-level guidance. Recommend running before the curation deadline.`,

  curation: `Store curation status:

• **Submitted:** 18 / 70 stores (26%)
• **Curation window:** Closes in **9 days**
• **Not started:** 8 stores in Gulf cluster ⚠️
• **Pending:** ~52 stores remaining

Gulf cluster stores at risk: Austin Central, Dallas Uptown, Houston South, San Antonio Pro, and 4 others. Auto-close is set for **Sep 20** — stores not submitted by then will receive agent defaults.`,

  national: `National Core status:

• **Locked SKUs:** 5 (National Core approved)
• **Status:** ✅ Core locked and downstream

The 5 Core SKUs have been approved and the National Core lock is active. Regional and store-level picks are now open on top of the Core base. No further changes to Core are allowed without VP approval.`,

  regional: `Regional review status:

• **Submitted:** 6 of 8 clusters
• **Pending:** Mid-Atlantic (GA) and Pacific South (CA)
• **Status:** Review open · lock date TBD

Pro-Heavy South, DIY-Heavy West, DIY-Heavy South, Pro-Heavy Midwest, Gulf Coast, and Northeast Urban have all submitted. Awaiting Mid-Atlantic and Pacific South leads to finalise their regional recommendations before the lock date is set.`,

  intel: `Market intelligence — 7 signals active:

**Competitor threats (2):**
1. Flooring competitor launching expanded tile line in Southeast — 12 stores at risk
2. Big-box retailer running LVP promotion through Oct — DIY-Heavy stores impacted

**Opportunity (1):**
• Natural stone demand up 18% YoY in Pacific South — recommend expanding C4 stone SKUs

**Trends (4):** Indoor ceramic +6%, LVP slowing in Mountain region, grout accessories outperforming, heated floor tiles emerging in Northeast.`,

  pipeline: `FW 2025 pipeline progress — **63% complete**:

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| Portfolio Build | ✅ Done |
| Forecast Receipt | ✅ Done |
| Catalogue | ▶ Active (agent pending) |

| Regional Review | ◑ Partial (6/8 clusters) |
| Store Curation | ▶ Active (18/70 done) |
| MPI / NPI | ⏳ Pending |

Critical path: Run the agent in Catalogue, then complete store curation before the window closes.`,
